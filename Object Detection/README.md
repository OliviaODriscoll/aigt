# Object-detection
-Code for CISC 881 Final Project

-code in keras_frcnn, train_frcnn, test_frcnn, and measure_map was cloned from: https://github.com/kbardool/keras-frcnn

   -I do not claim ownership of this code aside from the following modifications:
   
       -updating to work with latest version of tensorflow/keras
       
       -altering train-frcnn to use early stopping and validation set
       
       -altering test-frcnn to write bounding boxes to a csv file
       
   - My work is predominantly in EvaluateFRCNN
